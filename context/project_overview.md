# MCP-Code (MCP-NOSTR) Project Overview

## Purpose

This project acts as a bridge between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Nostr network. Its primary function is to enable AI language models, interacting via MCP, to publish content directly to the Nostr decentralized social network.

## Key Features

- **MCP Server Implementation:** Listens for MCP messages (stdin) and responds (stdout), allowing interaction with AI models.
- **Nostr Publishing:** Facilitates publishing content generated by AI models to the Nostr network.
- **CLI Interface:** Provides command-line tools for managing Nostr identities, profiles, content publishing, and other Nostr-related tasks.
- **Identity Management:** Handles Nostr keys and profiles.
- **Web of Trust (WoT):** Includes support for WoT features.
- **User Management:** Manages user profiles and follow lists within the Nostr context.
- **Code Snippet Sharing:** Allows publishing and finding code snippets on Nostr.
- **Zaps:** Supports sending and receiving zaps (Bitcoin Lightning tips).

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: For MCP communication.
    - `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk`: For Nostr protocol interactions.
    - `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-wallet`: For Nostr wallet integration (Zaps).
    - `commander`: For building the CLI interface.
    - `better-sqlite3`: For local database storage.

## Configuration

Configuration details (like user keys, relays) are typically stored in `~/.mcp-nostr.json` (Note: This path might need confirmation or could be configurable).
